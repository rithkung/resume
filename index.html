  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>
    I am a final-year B.Sc. Physics student at Mahidol University with a strong background in
    theoretical and computational physics, including cosmology, astroparticle physics, and
    large-scale numerical simulation. My recent focus is on applying data-driven and
    AI-based approaches to real-world system-level problems, particularly in health systems,
    patient navigation, and equitable access to care.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am especially interested in problems where complex constraints — such as capacity,
    referral structure, and institutional rules — shape outcomes more strongly than
    individual-level decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>Hackathon Focus</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>AI-powered global patient navigation</strong> that assesses care needs and routes users
    across health-system constraints (e.g. capacity limits, referral pathways, and access rules)
    to appropriate health services, with integrated appointment booking.
  </p>
  <p>
    The emphasis is on coordination rather than diagnosis: reducing friction between patients
    and the correct level of care across heterogeneous health systems.
